## What is the DOM?

-----

What is the DOM?? : The DOM or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that allows us to create, change or remove elements from the HTML document created




Why do we use the DOM?? : 
- You are watching TV and you need to change the channel. Its obvious you do not have telekinesis, so you need a remote, or other set of controls to change it. The Remote is a BRIDGE between the TV and the channel you want to change to. 
- Translating that back to coding terms, Javascript and HTML are great, but they do not have much power by themselves. To dynamically change your HTML you need a bridge between it and Javascript. This is where the DOM comes in.


The Document Object Model is a tree of  HTML nodes (or elements) created by the browser (via your HTML file). 

- It starts with our document (HTML file), and reads from the top down. It creates a family tree of ALL the elements in our HTML document so we are able to access them when we want. How cool is that?

- Browsers represent the html document as a JS object. This means that we can access individual components of "The DOM" the same way we would access individual components of a JS object.
