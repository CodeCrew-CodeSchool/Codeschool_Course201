<!-- Let's create an HTML document! -->

<!-- THE BEGINNING -->

<!-- We need to tell our browser what type of document we are using -->

<!-- I need a certain tag that represents the container for my HTML elements  -->

<!-- I need somewhere to put my metadata (data about HTML) what do I need here? -->

<!-- TRUE or FALSE: The end user (browser view) can see ALL the code above? -->
--------------------------------

<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

<!-- We need yet another container to wrap our HTML code displayed to the user. -->

<!-- We are going to add several HTML pages. We need a section to navigate to them quickly-->

<!-- Lets make 3 other containers for each of our sections. How should we do this? -->

<!-- We should style our containers depending on what section they are in. We should give them names.. -->

<!-- We need text to show in each container.. How should we do this? -->

<!-- We need some text to be bold, and some text to be italic. Any ideas?  -->

<!-- We should add images too. How can we add them? -->



<!-- ENDING -->

<!-- We need a section with the same page links for quick navigation. We need a container here, right? -->
