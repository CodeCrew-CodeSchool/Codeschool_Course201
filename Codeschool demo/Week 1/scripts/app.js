// Javascript review!

// Is there a way to check if my JS is working properly?


// We need a way to greet our users when they open our page..

// How are we supposed to know our user's name? Is there a way to store it?

// TRUE or FALSE: the keyword 'var' is acceptable to use when declaring variables?

// We need to make sure the first letter of thier name is capitalized after they enter it.

// It would help to know more about our users; How old are they, What is thier favorite thing to do on the weekend? etc...

// We might need to add quick statements in our JS file so other developers can see what we have / are working on.

// Our JS needs some spice to it..What else can we add?
